## INTRODUCTION

For Project 4, our group will be exploring diabetes in adults 18 and older within the US.

According to the CDC nearly 1 in 10 Americans live with the disease. With the dataset, Group 4 will explore the relationships between those with type diabetes, pre-diabetes, and those without diabetes utilizing 253,680 survey responses from cleaned BRFSS 2015 + balanced dataset. Survey comes from CDC and were collected monthly in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Guam. 

While analyzing the data, we had the following questions in mind:

* QUESTION 1

	What risk factors are most predictive of diabetes?

* QUESTION 2

	Which risk factors are the least predictive of diabetes?

* QUESTION 3

	Can a subset of risk factors accurately predict an individuals risk of diabetes?


## METHODS

There are many more questions that we can answer with this dataset. Apart from compiling visualizations utilizing Tableau, we ran multiple Machine Learning Models with different combinations of risk factors provided by the survey. We then compared our results and their predictive scores to observe which model/risk factors affected the model's predictive capabilities. 


## RESULTS

* Visualizations:
	For preliminary analysis, we plotted visualizations for each variable within the dataset vs. diabetes risk indicator utilizing Tableau.
